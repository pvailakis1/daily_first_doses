# daily_first_doses
Our World in Data unfortunately does not provide a visualisation of daily first doses for covid vaccination, but since it provides data on people vaccinated I created a simple R script to plot daily first doses for the chosen countries.  The script first imports the latest covid owid data from https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv and after retaining the relevant rows and columns it iterates through the resulting data frame creating a new column for the seven day average daily first doses. The data frame is lastly plotted using ggplot.
